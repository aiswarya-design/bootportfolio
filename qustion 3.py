# #what are the 5 main features of python?
# 1)highlevel programming language
# 2)general purpose language
# 3)dynamic programing language
# 4)interactive mode
# 5)interpreted programming language
#
# #what are the built in types in python?
# 1)numeric (int,float,complex)
# int=1
# float=1.5
# complex=1+4j
# 2)string ""
# 3)mapping data
# dictionary {key:value}
# 4)sequance  data types
# list [1,2,3,]
# tuple(1,2,3)
#
# #what is slicing?
# to retreive the character in a index position
# #what are the differnt between list and tuple?
# list --> mutable, square bracket[]
# tuple--> immutable, paranthesis()
# #what is dictionary?
# dictionary is a key value pair
# d={"name": "achu", "age":20}
# #what are the condition ina set?
# 1) unique data in a set
# 2)it is not allowed duplication
# 3)it is mutable
# #what is membership operators?
# in,out in
#
# # what is the exponention operator?
# it is used to check the power of a digit
# # what is floor division operator?
# it is used to slice the  fdloating point of a digit
# # what is the conditional operator ?4 types?syntax
# 1)arithematic operator(+,-,*,/,%,**,//)
# +- addition
# - - subtraction
# *- product
# /- quotient
# %- remainder
# **- exponention
# //-floor division

# given a string s?print the string from 4th index position  to end of the string?
# s=input("enter the string")
# print(s[4])
# given a list?print the third element of alist?
# l=["1","2.5","int","name"]
# l[3]="name"
# print(l[3])
# given a dictionary d?how to update the 'age'of the key of dictionary into 27?
# d={"name":"arun","age":"23","place":"tvm"}
# d["age"]="27"
# print(d)
# given atuple t=(1,2,3)?what is output of t[1]=t[1}+1;print(t)
# error tuple is not mutable
# #What is the ordinal value of character 'l'?
print(ord("l"))
# #how to convert dictionary into tuple?
# d.items()
